"Class diagram is missing, There is a file in some strange xml format but I cannot view that. You have missed a crucial design point. The controller should not need changing when a third view is added. I.e. part of the design problem is to make the controller unaware of the concrete languages. From your controller code: if(view.getLanguageType()== LanguageType.SVENSKA) { int ch=view.showMainMenuSe(); mainChoice=ch; }else if(view.getLanguageType()==LanguageType.ENGLISH) { int ch=view.showMainMenu(); mainChoice=ch; }else { //Other languages } This means you have essentially missed the actual design task here. Also you have added Language ype the model and there is view responsibility in the model classes (Boat.toString()). I can also not really find any handling of the boat length in feet or meters in the model. There is also hidden depencies between view and contoller. "
