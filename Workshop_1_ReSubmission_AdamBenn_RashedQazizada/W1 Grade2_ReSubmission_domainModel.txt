Domain Model:


In the domain model the conceptual classes involved are: Member, Boat, Boat Details, Membership Fee, Berth, Reservation, Calendar, Event.
The Member pays the “Membership” Fee which enables the Member to own “Boats”. Another important point to note is that, the number of Boats influences the “Member ship Fee”.
The “Boat” class is associated with the “Berth class” and there exists a “Reservation” class which dependent on the “Boat” and “Berth” class. This class keeps the history of the Berth assigned.
The Calendar class contains the Event class which list the events.
